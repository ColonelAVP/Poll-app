# ⭕ Poll app using Django 
## ▶️ Introduction
This project walks you through creating a basic poll application. It’s got two parts:
- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An administrative interface that lets you add, change and delete polls.

>Installation Guide: 
``pip install django``

``Note``
```
Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, 
so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.
